# Ryan-UILib

This UI library is a comprehensive set of React components built with Next.js, styled with Tailwind CSS and Radix UI, representing the perfect amalgamation of performance, flexibility, and usability.

## About This Library

This UI library serves as a pre-styled, pre-tested set of building blocks, allowing developers to focus on creating unique, complex features rather than reinventing common UI elements. By offering a consistent, unified style across different components, we ensure that your application maintains a cohesive, polished look, enhancing user experience.

Built on top of Next.js, this library brings you the performance benefits of server-side rendering and static site generation. It leverages Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling, giving you granular control over the appearance of your components while maintaining the benefits of a CSS framework. Lastly, using Radix UI ensures accessibility is at the forefront, so you can be confident that your app is usable by all, regardless of abilities.

## Why I'm Building This

Dealing with inconsistencies, cross-browser issues, and accessibility concerns can be tedious and time-consuming. By abstracting away these details into a reusable library, I want to empower myself as well as the developers I work with to build beautiful, accessible, and consistent UIs swiftly and efficiently. 

## Usage
Note: Future plans are to turn this into a node module, but for now this is a proof of concept

```
import { ComponentName } from 'your-ui-library-name';

// In your component
<ComponentName>Content</ComponentName>
```
Please refer to individual component documentation for detailed usage instructions.
